# Project Info

Followed along a tutorial https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8p2I9GklV45pe55ZVEEhk8elLZLh932A to learn more about redux-saga, modified some of the parts to make the code more efficient for example used state and useEffects instead of local variables. Added some own basic styling.

User can add products to cart and remove them. User can empty all items from the cart. User can navigate between pages (implemented by react-router) and can also search for items.
